Step 1: Heat the oil in a large, wide pan with a lid, add the chicken, then fry quickly until lightly coloured. Add the onion and ginger, then fry for a further 2 mins.

Vegan burger
vegan burger
Time: 5-10 mins
Serves: 10 mins
Ingredients	Quantity
shallot	1 chopped
celery	1 stick
parsley lesves	1 bunch
can chickpeas , drained and left to dry a little	400 g
garam masala	1-2 tsp
tomato purée	1 tbsp
plain flour	2 tbsp
polenta , couscous, or dried breadcrumbs	1 tbsp
oil, for frying	1 tbsp
burger buns or pitta bread, lettuce, tomato, and sauces to serve	-
Step 1: Whizz the shallot, celery, parsley and most of the chickpeas to a coarse paste. Don’t overdo this, you want a texture slightly rougher than hummus. Mash the remaining chickpeas and stir them into the paste with the garam masala, tomato purée, flour and polenta. Season well.

Step 2: Shape the mixture into four patties. Let them rest for at least 30 mins – you can leave them overnight in the fridge if you like. The polenta needs time to absorb any extra liquid.

Step 3: Heat a little oil in a non-stick frying pan and cook the patties until they’re brown and crisp on each side. Try not to handle them too much as they’ll be quite soft when warm. Slide into buns or pitta with the accompaniments that you’d like.
